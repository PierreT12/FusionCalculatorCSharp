# FusionCalculatorCSharp
The C# Version of my Fusion Calculator

This is a persona project that I was working on in C#. It can do a couple of basic features but needs to be cleaned up a bit.  
I'm currently focusing on the C++ Version though. 


# SQLite Database
The database I made was too large to be uploaded to Github.  
So here's a [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NNI8SEbtjX9Yu8piW7XSFhn0FfF9m5nS/view?usp=sharing) link to it.  


# Current Features

Displays Persona Information (Name, Acrana Level, Stat, Magic Etc.) from database  
Loads in images properly for each persona
Can open Fusion Page and perform fusion

# Future Features

Forward Fusion 
About Page
Treasure Demons  
Inherited Skills

# Known Issue

For some fusions duplicate results show up
