# FusionCalculatorCSharp
The __old__ C# Version of my Fusion Calculator
 
 Edit:  
 I'll no longer be using this repository for my C# Calculator please look at [this one](https://github.com/PierreT12/FusionCalcCSharpRedux) if you want to see the newest version. This one is quiet a mess and I made a lot of stupid mistakes so I'm redoing it. I'll leave this up just in case, but I've warned you, it doesn't look pretty. 
------------------------------------------------------------------


This is a persona project that I was working on in C#. It can do a couple of basic features but needs to be cleaned up a bit.  
I'm currently focusing on the [C++ Version](https://github.com/PierreT12/FusionCalculatorCpp) though, so if you want to see a more complete/clean version, check that one out first.  
This isn't as well put together as that one, but it still does run and perform what I need it to do, it just includes more hotfixes than I'd like to admit.  


# SQLite Database
The database I made was too large to be uploaded to Github.  
So here's a [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NNI8SEbtjX9Yu8piW7XSFhn0FfF9m5nS/view?usp=sharing) link to it.
